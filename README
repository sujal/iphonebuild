iphonebuild.sh

This is a simple build script that was originally written by Frank Szczerba at 
http://carpe-cocoa.com/2009-05-24/iphone-application-packaging/

My goals for this are simple:

- add better support for spaces in Targets & Build Configurations
- copy the provisioning profile used for the build to the output directory
- support SVN & Perforce in addition to Git

As of right now, all but the Perforce support is in there.  I also haven't decided on a good way to
abstract tagging for SVN, so I simply skipped support for it. Open to suggestions, so let me know if you have one.

My changes might be buggy (though it's been working great for me :-) ), so please report issues.  Thanks.
